    <a href = 'http://www.babyspherez.appspot.com' target='_blank'>Babysphere</a> was 
    designed for Nannies and Moms to come together and interact through various ways. This is through sharing funny stories, activities, 
    job postings, and giveaways. This application was created in the python framework, 
    <a href = 'http://www.web2py.com' target='_blank'>Web2py</a>. It was completed during my first year as a Graduate Student.

  %h3.italic <span>Statefarm's Lead Response Site (Internal)</span>
  %p
    Currently (@Tukaiz), I work on State Farm's Lead Response Site. It's an internal application for handling leads
    through marketing vehicles which makes a campaign. This is done in Rails 3 while utilizing technologies: Ruby, Coffeescript,
    JQuery, Javascript, Haml/HTML, and MySql for data storage.
  
  %h3.italic <span>This Site!</span>
  %p
    This site was created in Sinatra (A Ruby Framework). <img src='/images/sinatra.png' class='sinatra'/>
    I wanted to put something more than just a resume on the web and ruby's lightweight framework, Sinatra, fit the bill. 
    I'm ecstatic that the ruby community is constantly innovating the way we use technology today and sharing these contributions. Ruby is
    certainly a nice language to learn and with practice, you'll become a rubyist too.
